# OpenFoam_Cases

## Case 1 
Inspired by Yan Xiaohui (from Bilibili), a T-shape model is executed to examine some basic openfoam functions.

1. Coordinate System
2. Geometry
3. Auxiliary Line/ vertices/ block determination/ Numerate Vertices
4. block Mesh Dict documentation !!!! Important!!!
5. Boundary condition
6. ParaFoam post-processing
